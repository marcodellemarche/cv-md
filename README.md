# Curriculum Vitae Markdown

❗ The important stuff starts here ❗

Hi everyone! This repository is a template and it's meant to be used as a starting point for your Curriculum Vitae.

Come on, updating the CV is already boring by itself, imagine having to take care of its formatting as well. So the idea is to update a single Markdown file, like this README, and a Github Action will take care of the rest. It will:

- Put the CV online on **Github Pages**, built with Jekyll. You can even use a custom domain if you'd like. You don't need to worry too much about the formatting. Feel free to move from Jekyll to [one of these](https://github.com/pages-themes).
- Convert it to a **PDF**, which is uploaded as the `latest` Release. A link to it can be found a few lines above, so it can be easily downloaded by the online version of the CV.

At every commit into the `main` branch, everything will be rebuilt and updated.

Thus, the only thing you need to update is this README. And most importantly, before starting, there are a couple things to do:

- **Update the links in the template below**, especially the link to the PDF. Just change `marcodellemarche/cvmd` with your Github username and repository name.
- Enable Github Pages for your repo. Go to *Settings*, *Pages*, then under *Build and deployment* set the source to **Github Actions**.
- You need to re-run once again the failed Action.

*Pro tip*: if you need to force a page break into the PDF, simply use the following HTML element.

```html
<div class="page-break"></div>
```

That's it for today, I'll leave you to the fake CV you might take inspiration from. See ya! 👋
